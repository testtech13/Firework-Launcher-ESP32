There are several different interfaces depending on how you what to interact with the Launcher.  

One will be to use serial commands to talk to the Launcher over RS232 say using a Raspberry PI.  
Next will be use the same serial commands but use bluetooth and a App on a mobile device.  
Last is to use a ESP32 with integrated web page interface
